Decid.er
=========
Summary
---------
-Decid.er is a basic rails application for making decisions for a group based on majority vote.
-Users can submit problems within a group that need to be decided upon, along with any number of possible decisions.
-Other members of the group can either submit a single possible decision or vote on an existing decision.
-The creator of a problem can determine a timeframe for making a decision on their problem.
-When the end of the timeframe is reached, the decision with the most votes will win.
-If there is a tie, a winner will be chosen at random from the possible decisions tied for first.
